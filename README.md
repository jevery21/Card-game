# Card-game
This was a coursework project that I completed with Niklas Rahmel as part of the Software Development module of the University of Exeter's Computer Science and ITMB courses. 

We were tasked with simulating a card game using a user defined number of players and number of cards in decks and hands.

This project was to enable us to show our understanding of the areas of Java that we were taught during the module, 
such as generics, threading, design patterns and event handling. 

If you want to run the program, then just run the Jar file.
